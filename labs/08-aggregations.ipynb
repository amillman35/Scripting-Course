    "For references, here are the most notable *stages* of the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\$match**: Select a subset of data (as you can do with 'find')\n",
    "- **\\$sort**: Order data by the values of a certain key\n",
    "- **\\$group**: Group data based on a key - like 'groupby' in Pandas\n",
    "- **\\$limit**: Trim the number of documents in the dataset\n",
    "- **\\$unwind**: Deconstruct an array, so that there is a document for every value of the array\n",
