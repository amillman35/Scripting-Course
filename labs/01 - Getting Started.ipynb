        "Your _environment_ is similar to your local workspace. Look at your desk: how do you organize your pens, paper, mouse, monitor? Or maybe you have a barebones workspace, working at a coffee shop or kitchen table with only a cup of coffee. In the same way, you can have many different environments for how you work with Python: working on a command line, or running scripts. Colaboratory is an environment that gives you an interactive, browser-based version of Python. It allows you to play with code in a way that gives you immediate feedback, and allows you to break, tinker, and retry. \n",
        "\n",
        "Colaboratory, or 'Colab' for short, is Google's spinoff of a notebook tool called Jupyter. The main difference is that Jupyter is usually installed on your own computer, but Google has installed Colab on their servers and made it accessible to anybody with a Google account. Past versions of this class used Jupyter - so you may still references to it - and it is *very* common in all manner of information science, data science, and machine learning industries. Just know that Colab is a spin-off of that.\n",
        "\n",
        "When programming, you're usually not writing everything from scratch. Some code is needed by many other people, so most languages have a concept of a _library_: code written and distributed by other people that you can easily use in your own work.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this class, we work with a specific set of libraries for Python that people have created for working with data and dataset. In code, when you see `import X`, that is you loading a library - somebody elses code that make your life easier.\n",
